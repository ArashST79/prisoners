# Incarceration Rates

Statistics about incarceration are generally taken from the [Prison Policy Whole Pie](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html) report, which is the most complete and rigorous report on incarceration in any country. Countries other than the United States are [gathered from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate). In cases where Wikipedia and Prison Policy Initiative differ, the latter is considered authoritative here. The reason for this is that PPI includes incarcerated persons wrongly excluded by other reports, such as juvenile inmates and those held in immigration detention. Regardless of the precise number, both sources agree that the United States is first in both absolute numbers and per capita incarceration.

There are a few countries where state secrecy slightly complicates the situation, but none fundamentally alter the picture of the United States as the unrivaled global leader in incarceration. For instance, the precise number held in North Korean prison camps is not publically known, though [some sources put the number from 150,000 to 200,000](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13618693-the-hidden-gulag). This would be an incarceration rate between 600 (slightly lower than the United States) and 800 (slightly higher).

In 2017 China began incarcerating members of the Muslim Uyghur ethnic minority in secret camps. Very little is known about the number held, the conditions of the camps, or the length of the detention. Most sources report the number at around 1 million, though [this is at best an educated guess](https://qz.com/1599393/how-researchers-estimate-1-million-uyghurs-are-detained-in-xinjiang/). If the 1 million figure is accurate, China would have the largest incarcerated population in absolute numbers, beating out the United States by 17%, but still 359% fewer per capita.

We should not regard human rights abuses abroad as somehow vindicating those committed at home. There is little difference from a policy perspective between an America with the world's highest incarceration rate, and an America just slightly edged out by North Korea. Both are worthy of condemnation.

# Incarceration Compared To Professions

* There are about [1.3 active duty members of the US military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces) and 850,000 reservists.
* There are [613,350 bartenders](https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes353011.htm)
* There are [179,510 bus drivers](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes533052.htm)
* There are [385,960 hairdressers](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes395012.htm).
* Bar tenders, bus drivers, and hairdressers combined equal 1,178,820.

# Violence Against Women

The direct costs of treating victims of domestic violence and [lost productivity are estimated](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1585/text) at $8.3 billion ([see also](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/IPVBook-a.pdf)). About [160,000 people are incarcerated for domestic violence](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvs08.pdf), or violence against an unmarried romantic partner. The average cost to incarcerate someone is [$33,274](https://www.vera.org/publications/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends-prison-spending) meaning the total cost to incarcerate all domestic abusers is around $5.3 billion. This does not include the cost of police, courts, or public defenders, only the cost of incarceration. This brings the total national cost of domestic violence to $13.6 billion. The total allocations made by the Violence Against Women act were [$558 million in 2019](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R45410.html#_Toc6934690). The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act provides an additional $180 million. This obviously excludes state, local, and private charity spending, which are likely significant, but no unified dataset tracks the total value.

# Cost of Incarceration

Incarceration directly costs between [$80](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/12/17/the-hidden-cost-of-incarceration) billion and [$180](https://eji.org/news/mass-incarceration-costs-182-billion-annually/) billion depending on how exactly you count. For instance, some figures include the initial cost of affecting an arrest into the cost of incarceration, others do not. This is dwarfed by the cost of [preventable crime and lost productivity](https://review.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Gifford-71-Stan.-L.-Rev.-71-2019.pdf) which is almost certainly counted in trillions.

# Savings from Supportive Housing

The annual cost of [supportive housing](https://www.cbpp.org/research/housing/supportive-housing-helps-vulnerable-people-live-and-thrive-in-the-community) is around $20,000 per homeless person. As stated by the Federal Interagency Council on Homelessness, the [cost of people sleeping on the street](https://www.usich.gov/resources/uploads/asset_library/Ending_Chronic_Homelessness_in_2017.pdf) is much more:

> Without connections to the right types of care, they cycle in and out of hospital emergency departments and inpatient beds, detox programs, jails, prisons, and psychiatric institutionsâ€”all at high public expense. Some studies have found that leaving a person to remain chronically homeless costs taxpayers as much as $30,000 to $50,000 per year.

This does not count the lost productivity, increased crime, or reduced property values, all of which are well known side effects of increased homelessness. Also note, the cost of supportive housing is likely temporary whereas the cost of managing homelessness is permanent.

A pilot program in Los Angeles found a [net savings of 60% after one year of supportive housing](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1694.html).
