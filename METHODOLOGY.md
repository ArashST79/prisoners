# Incarceration Rates

Statistics about American incarceration are generally taken from the [Prison Policy Whole Pie](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html) report, which is the most complete and rigorous report on incarceration in any country. Countries other than the United States are [gathered from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate). In cases where Wikipedia and Prison Policy Initiative differ, the latter is considered authoritative here. The reason for this is that PPI includes incarcerated persons wrongly excluded by other reports, such as juvenile inmates and those held in immigration detention. Regardless of the precise number, both sources agree that the United States is first in both absolute numbers and per capita incarceration.

There are a few countries where state secrecy slightly complicates the situation, but none fundamentally alter the picture of the United States as the unrivaled global leader in incarceration. For instance, the precise number held in North Korean prison camps is not publically known, though [some sources put the number from 150,000 to 200,000](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13618693-the-hidden-gulag). This would be an incarceration rate between 600 (slightly lower than the United States) and 800 (slightly higher).

In 2017 China began incarcerating members of the Muslim Uyghur ethnic minority in secret camps. Very little is known about the number held, the conditions of the camps, or the length of the detention. Most sources report the number at around 1 million, though [this is at best an educated guess](https://qz.com/1599393/how-researchers-estimate-1-million-uyghurs-are-detained-in-xinjiang/). If the 1 million figure is accurate, China would have the largest incarcerated population in absolute numbers, beating out the United States by 17%, but still 359% fewer per capita.

We should not regard human rights abuses abroad as somehow vindicating those committed at home. There is little difference from a policy perspective between an America with the world's highest incarceration rate, and an America just slightly edged out by North Korea. Both are worthy of condemnation.

# Incarceration Compared To Professions

* There are about [1.3 active duty members of the US military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces) and 850,000 reservists.
* There are [613,350 bartenders](https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes353011.htm)
* There are [179,510 bus drivers](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes533052.htm)
* There are [385,960 hairdressers](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes395012.htm).
* Bar tenders, bus drivers, and hairdressers combined equal 1,178,820.

# American War Dead
There have been [1.3 million Americans killed in war and 1.5 million wounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war). Of these, 666,441 were combat deaths.

# Total Correctional Population

* About [4.9 million will be incarcerated this year](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/repeatarrests.html).
* As of 2001, there were [5.6 million adults who had ever been to prison](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/piusp01.pdf). We will assume that about the same number of adults today have ever been to prison, though in reality it is probably higher. A baby born in 2001 was projected to have a [6.6%](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/piusp01.pdf) lifetime chance of going to prison. There are around [80 million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/241488/population-of-the-us-by-sex-and-age/) Americans born in 2001 or later, meaning there are another 5.3 million juveniles now alive who can expect to be imprisoned at some point. These two figures (adults previously incarcerated, plus juveniles who will eventually be incarcerated) gives us the minimum number of living Americans who have ever been or will ever go to prison: 10.9 million. Missing from this figure are adults who have _not yet_ been to prison, but will eventually. This is likely a sizable number, but smaller than the other two because risk of imprisonment peaks in early adulthood. This is all to say, 10.9 million is certainly an undercount of the total number.
* [77 million have a criminal record](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html). "Criminal record" here means that an individual appears in the Federal Department of Justice [Survey of State Criminal
History Information Systems](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bjs/grants/251516.pdf).
* [113 million *adults*](https://everysecond.fwd.us/downloads/EverySecond.fwd.us.pdf) have ever had an immediate family member incarcerated (parent, sibling, or child). Children are excluded from this statistic, meaning the actual number is certainly much higher, but no one has gathered this data. Also excluded from this statistic are people who have had household members outside their immediate family incarcerated (grand parents, for instance).

# Plea Bargains

Around [97% of criminal cases](https://www.nacdl.org/Document/TrialPenaltySixthAmendmentRighttoTrialNearExtinct) resolve in a guilty plea, though the exact number is difficult to know, because there is no unified reporting system for this data across every jurisdiction. Not all incarcerated people have been convictedâ€”around [555,000 incarcerated Americans have not been convicted](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html) or entered a guilty plea, mostly held in pre-trial detention. So while around 3% or *convicts* had a trial (about 50,000 people) only around 2% of incarcerated people had trials, because not all incarcerated people are convicts.

For data comparing the United States to plea bargaining in other countries, see [The Disappearing Trial](https://www.fairtrials.org/sites/default/files/publication_pdf/Report-The-Disappearing-Trial.pdf).

# Pre Trial Detainees

Around [555,000 people in the United States are held without conviction](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html), almost entirely people awaiting trial.

# Comparison to Europe

The number of people incarcerated for each race may be calculated by multiplying the [incarceration rate per race](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cpus10.pdf) by the [total national population of each race](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219).

Numbers incarcerated in Europe may be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate).

# Comparison to USSR

Soviet incarceration [under Stalin peaked in 1951](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2166597?origin=JSTOR-pdf&seq=1) at 2.5 million. This includes individuals held in gulags, labor colonies, and conventional prisons. The population of the Soviet Union was 182 million in 1951, making the incarceration rate 1,373 per hundred thousand.

The average for all countries can be determined by adding up [wikipedia data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate) and then dividing it by the total number of countries in the list.

The incarceration rate for black men in America [can be found here](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cpus10.pdf). The incarceration rate for black people generally can be found by averaging the male and female rates. Obviously this assumes an equal number of male and female black Americans, so this number may be off by a percent or two.

# Lifetime Imprisonment Risk

The lifetime risk of imprisonment for various racial groups can be found [here](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/piusp01.pdf).

# Police Shooting

Police are estimated to kill between [930 and 1,240](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_United_States) Americans each year.

# Legal Penalties For George Floyd

# Estimated Prison Populations

* [North Korean Incarceration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate#North_Korea)
* [Uyghur Detention](https://qz.com/1599393/how-researchers-estimate-1-million-uyghurs-are-detained-in-xinjiang/)
* Incarceration of [American racial and age groups](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cpus10.pdf).
* Incarceration in [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate) (this is not an estimate, it is an official figure, but it's included to have a "normal" number for a sense of scale).

# Violence Against Women

The direct costs of treating victims of domestic violence and [lost productivity are estimated](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1585/text) at $8.3 billion ([see also](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/IPVBook-a.pdf)). About [160,000 people are incarcerated for domestic violence](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvs08.pdf), or violence against an unmarried romantic partner. The average cost to incarcerate someone is [$33,274](https://www.vera.org/publications/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends-prison-spending) meaning the total cost to incarcerate all domestic abusers is around $5.3 billion. This does not include the cost of police, courts, or public defenders, only the cost of incarceration. This brings the total national cost of domestic violence to $13.6 billion. The total allocations made by the Violence Against Women act were [$558 million in 2019](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R45410.html#_Toc6934690). The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act provides an additional $180 million. This obviously excludes state, local, and private charity spending, which are likely significant, but no unified dataset tracks the total value.

# Cost of Incarceration

Incarceration directly costs between [$80](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/12/17/the-hidden-cost-of-incarceration) billion and [$180](https://eji.org/news/mass-incarceration-costs-182-billion-annually/) billion depending on how exactly you count. For instance, some figures include the initial cost of affecting an arrest into the cost of incarceration, others do not. This is dwarfed by the cost of [preventable crime and lost productivity](https://review.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Gifford-71-Stan.-L.-Rev.-71-2019.pdf) which is almost certainly counted in trillions.

# Savings from Supportive Housing

The annual cost of [supportive housing](https://www.cbpp.org/research/housing/supportive-housing-helps-vulnerable-people-live-and-thrive-in-the-community) is around $20,000 per homeless person. As stated by the Federal Interagency Council on Homelessness, the [cost of people sleeping on the street](https://www.usich.gov/resources/uploads/asset_library/Ending_Chronic_Homelessness_in_2017.pdf) is much more:

> Without connections to the right types of care, they cycle in and out of hospital emergency departments and inpatient beds, detox programs, jails, prisons, and psychiatric institutionsâ€”all at high public expense. Some studies have found that leaving a person to remain chronically homeless costs taxpayers as much as $30,000 to $50,000 per year.

This does not count the lost productivity, increased crime, or reduced property values, all of which are well known side effects of increased homelessness. Also note, the cost of supportive housing is likely temporary whereas the cost of managing homelessness is permanent.

A pilot program in Los Angeles found a [net savings of 60% after one year of supportive housing](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1694.html).
